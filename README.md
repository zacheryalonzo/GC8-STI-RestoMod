# GC8 STI Build Log

This repo documents the restoration and performance build of my Subaru 1996 GC8 chassis, featuring a full STI drivetrain swap and an ej205 wrx motor. It includes detailed notes on fabrication, tuning prep, and ongoing upgrades.

## Build Goals
- Responsive and reliable street car with occasional track/drag use
- Clean OEM+ look with modern performance
- Build everything possible in-house (welding, fab, wiring, paint job, etc.)

## Current Setup
- **Engine:** EJ205 from an 02 wrx
- **Turbo:** VF48 with external wastegate from 2018 STI
- **Drivetrain:** 2005 STI full swap (front/rear subframes, hubs, brakes, R180)
- **Suspension:** BC Racing Coilovers, whiteline suspension with all new bushings
- **Fuel:** Flex-fuel kit (E85 capable), upgraded injectors and lines
- **Electronics:** ECU tuned and prepped, custom harness mods
- **Fabrication:** Custom intercooler from an 05 sti with IAT sensor, downpipe, TIG/MIG welding
- **Interior:** Clean OEM+ (05 STI interior) with future plans for 3D printed trim replacements 

## Fabrication Projects
- Exhaust mods (external WG dump)
- 3D printed top hat covers
- 3D printed brackets
- Engine bay hardware, spacers, and supports

## In Progress / To-Do
- Widebody planning
- Engine rebuild
- Carbon fiber/abs aero (homemade)
- More interior and chassis refinements

## Skills Applied & Learned
- TIG and MIG welding (chassis & aluminum work)
- 3D CAD (Solid Works/Fusion 360), slicing (Bambu Studio)
- Mechanical assembly, diagnostics, and electrical
- Problem-solving and real-world fabrication
